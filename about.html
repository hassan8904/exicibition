<p>John Kelleher from ESM Inbound discusses their About page as an example.<br> Originally, Kelleher wasn’t a fan of About pages: “Personally, I hate ‘About Us’ pages.<br> More often than not,<br> they go on and on about things that a potential customer doesn’t<br> care about. ‘172 years of combined experience’ — honestly, who cares?

As a result, I resisted having an ‘About Us’ page on our website. <br>I finally caved in when we were going through a major redesign and<br> our team made a compelling case that I’m an exception rather than a rule.<br> But I insisted that our ‘About Us’ page showed why we were really ‘About The Customer’.”<br>

So what makes their About Us page unique? <br>The simple fact that’s it written with their target customer in mind.<br>

Kelleher elaborates:<br> “Our ‘About Us’ page showcases our mission and values in a way that shows we<br>believe we’ll only succeed when our clients are happy. <br>We’ve avoided as much ‘history of the company’<br> information as possible in favor of ‘here are some things about us that you might actually care about’.<br> I’m so much happier with this</p>
